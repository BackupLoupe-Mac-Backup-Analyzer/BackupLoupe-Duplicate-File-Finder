BackupLoupe is a specialized utility that provides deep insight into your backup storage. It scans backup sets—particularly those from Time Machine—and presents a clear breakdown of content, highlighting duplicates, old versions, and files that can be safely deleted to reclaim space.

This tool is built for macOS users who want to maintain clean and efficient backups without manually sifting through thousands of files. It offers visual charts, size summaries, and filter options to help you make informed decisions about what to keep and what to remove.

BackupLoupe is compatible with all recent macOS releases and runs smoothly on both Intel and Apple Silicon hardware. It’s an essential tool for professionals, developers, and advanced users who need to manage large backup volumes regularly.

In addition to its core analysis features, BackupLoupe also includes options to export reports, compare backups, and preview files before deletion. This ensures you never lose important data while optimizing your storage footprint.
